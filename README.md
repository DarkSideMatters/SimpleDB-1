# SimpleDB-1
# Coded in Python. Not finished. So far it is reading and writing input in binary to file.
# Missing on indexing and storing a hashmap locally.
# Python is needed.
# To run you need to use a terminal, go to the directory where the file is and run it by
# typing "python simpledb.txt (param1) (param2)" where param1 and param2 are the entries
# written to the database.
